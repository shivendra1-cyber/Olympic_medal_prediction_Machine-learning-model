# Machine Learning Project: Predicting Olympic Medals

Welcome to the Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning Project! In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of building a machine learning model to predict how many medals a country will win in the Olympics based on historical and current data.

## Project Overview

### Overview
This project covers the full process of building a beginner-friendly machine learning project using Python and Jupyter notebooks. We'll use data from historical Olympic games to train our model.

### Steps Covered
1. **Formulate a Hypothesis**: Define the problem and set expectations.
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore and understand the dataset.
3. **Data Preparation**: Prepare the data for machine learning.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data.
5. **Error Metric**: Choose an appropriate metric to evaluate the model.
6. **Data Splitting**: Split the data into training and testing sets.
7. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to predict medal counts.

### Files Included
- `machine_learning.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the project code.
- `data_prep.ipynb`: Notebook for generating team-level dataset from athlete-level data.

## Local Setup

### Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn

### Data
We use Olympic data sourced originally from Kaggle:
- `teams.csv`: Team-level data used in this project.
- `athlete_events.csv`: Original athlete-level data (can be obtained from the Kaggle dataset).

## Code
